Generics:
* implement it
 ** Validate throws and throw-statements using generics

Bytecode generation:
* try/catch/finally

Add errors for:
* Validate that we return and have no unreachable code
 ** Handle basic list of statements
 ** Handle if/then/else
 ** Handle throws/catch/finally
 ** Handle loops
* Validate that final fields and variables are set once.
 ** Fields are set with initializer or set once in constructor
 ** Local variables are set once
* Error if switch case tries to use something that has already been handled (case String s -> ... ; case String s when ...)
* Check that TwoPartExpression with null only uses == or !=
* Check Pre/Post-Increment/Decrement are done on numeric types (integral types?)
* Ceck that DimExpr have an int expression
* Check that break and continue go to valid labels

Add warnings:
* useless casts
