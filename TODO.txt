Bytecode generation:
* do-while loops
* while loops
* try/catch/finally

Add errors for:
* Validate throws-clauses for method "void foo() throws A, B { ... }" -> A and B needs to be Throwables
* validate throws clauses for method contents: "void foo () { throw new Foo(); }" -> Foo needs to be Throwable
* Validate that we return and have no unreachable code
 ** Handle basic list of statements
 ** Handle if/then/else
 ** Handle throws/catch/finally
 ** Handle loops
* Validate that final fields and variables are set once.
 ** Fields are set with initializer or set once in constructor
 ** Local variables are set once
* Error if switch case tries to use something that has already been handled (case String s -> ... ; case String s when ...)

Add warnings:
* useless casts
